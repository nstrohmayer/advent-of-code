# Advent of Code 2023 - Python Learning Repository

This repository contains solutions to the Advent of Code puzzles for the year 2023. It serves as a learning space for Python, a language I've never used before, with the assistance of AI.

## Overview

Each puzzle solution is organized into directories according to their respective day and part (`1-1`, `1-2`, etc.). Under `resources`, you'll find input files (`day-01.txt`, `day-02.txt`, etc.) containing the puzzle input for each day.

## How it Works

This repository serves as a learning tool for Python programming. With the help of an AI assistant, I'm exploring Python's features, syntax, and problem-solving techniques by solving the puzzles from Advent of Code 2023.

## Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual coding event with daily programming puzzles released during December. These puzzles cover various difficulty levels and require problem-solving skills to advance.
